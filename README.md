### Project Summary

This project aims to develop a framework for analyzing vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) on dam spillway radial gates using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, specifically ANSYS Fluent. The project investigates the complex interactions between fluid flow and structural responses of the gates. Key objectives include:

- **Understanding VIV Mechanisms:** Explore the physics behind vortex-induced vibrations on radial gates through extensive literature review and analysis.
  
- **Developing a Numerical Framework:** Implement a robust CFD-based numerical framework to simulate fluid-structure interactions and quantify VIV effects.
  
- **Validating CFD Models:** Ensure the accuracy and reliability of CFD simulations by validating against experimental data and theoretical models.
  
- **Suggesting Design Improvements:** Propose practical design enhancements to improve the structural stability and lifespan of radial gates under VIV conditions.

The methodology encompasses literature review, 3D modeling, CFD simulation, data analysis, validation, and optimization. The expected outcomes include a comprehensive understanding of VIV phenomena, a validated CFD framework, and actionable design recommendations for enhancing the performance of radial gates.
